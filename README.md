### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Saurabh, I'm a full-stack web developer from Delhi, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. 

I'm experienced in Node.js, React, Typescript, and GraphQL. Apart from this I also have some experience in native mobile apps and rust.

I have worked extensively with third-party APIs including Shopify, Facebook, and Google.

  - Macro - An ad automation platform
  - Shopify Apps for e-commerce merchants 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - Rust
  - Jetpack Compose (Native Android Development)

  - High-performance web servers or frontend using rust or wasm
  - Native apps

  - Science stuff especially Cosmology 
  - Typescript or static types in general

- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - I was initially learning Ruby on Rail but [this post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code-my-own-eddb24d9d5a7/) pushed me to focus on javascript instead.
